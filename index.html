<h1><p align=center>RVAsec 2021 Badge</h1>
<p>Here you will find some documentation about your electronic
2021 RVAsec badge. Your badge is hand made and programmed by members
of <a href="https://hackrva.org">HackRVA</a>, Richmond's member-run
and non-profit makerspace.
<h2>Building the Badge</h2>

process here.

<h2>Making your own Badge Apps</h2>
<p>If you know C, and you've got a linux machine, making your own badge apps is not that difficult,
although you'll need a special cable to be able to flash the badge firmware and actually run it on
the badge.  However, you can try your hand at making a badge app even without the special cable and
without being able to flash the firmware using our handy dandy linux badge emulator. Maybe you can
make something cool that will show up on next year's badge.

<p>See the following documentation:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HackRVA/badge2020/tree/master/linux">linux/README.md</a>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HackRVA/badge2020/blob/master/BADGE-APP-HOWTO.md">Badge App HOWTO</a>
</ul>

<p>Also, take a look at the badge apps we've created as examples and use them for inspiration.
<h2>The C interpreter</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, the badge has a built-in C interpreter,
and you can send it small C programs via it's USB serial interface to
control the LEDs or the display.
<p>TODO elaborate on this.
<p>There are some examples at the bottom of this page:

<hr>
<p>You might have noticed that the repository is named HackRVA/badge2020, yet this is 2021.
Well, this is because of COVID.  We were gearing up for the 2020 RVAsec badge, but then
everything got cancelled. We just kind of picked up where we left off for 2021 and didn't
see a need to make a new repository.
